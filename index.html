    <title>My AkiraChix Progress</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>My experience at AkiraChix has been amazing to say the least. As each day passes by, i continue to learn new things and progress as a techie and from a 
        personal point of view. Below are some of the areas that has significantly continued to improve over the past four weeks.</p>

        <h1 style="color:darkblue;"><u>Problem Solving</u></h1>
        <p><ul>
            <li><b>Rational thinking:</B> AkiraChix has changed on how i approach problems and i have learned that problem solving needs logical thinking.</li>
            <li><b>Composure:</b> I have learnt that in orderto solve a problem, i have to maintain my composure while at it to think clearly. </li>
            <li><b>Understanding:</b> To be able to solve a problem, you must be able to first understand it clearly.</li>
            <li><b>Communication:</b> Being able to communicate efficiently when problem solving is a key tool incase you're asking for assistance or in a group.</li>
            <li><b>Choosing a solution:</b> AkiraChix has taught me time to time that every problem has a solution, multiple in fact. Choosing the right one is necessary.</li>

        <h2 style="color:darkblue;"><u>Perseverance</u></h2>
        <p><ul>
            <li><b>Discipline:</b> I've come to learn that discipline in the codeHive program is a must have. This is not just because of the rules but beacause of how intense the program is. Failure of it will cost yo personally and makes the program less intense thus fostering perseverance.</li>
            <li><b>Patience:</b> Since becoming a techie in the program, i have learnt that patience is vital in everything i do. When running codes or learning a new concept.</li>
            <li><b>Building resilience:</b> I quickly learnt in AkiraChix that i have leagit add rnt to have a thick skin and build up my resilience to help me through the program.</li>
            <li><b>Reflect:</b> I have to reflect upon myself time to time to mark my progress and motivate myself to be able to persevere throughout the program,failure to it discouragement might take over.</li>
            <li><b>Self confidence:</b> Given the nature of the program, believing in yourself is non-negotiable.</li>

        </p></ul>
